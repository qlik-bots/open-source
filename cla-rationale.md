# CLA Rationale

## Why do we require you to sign our CLA?

The CLA clarifies the responsibilities we as a company have, and what
you as a contributor have. It gives us an undeniable record that the
contribution was sent to us willingly, and that the contribution is given
to the open source project unconditionally.

It helps us guarantee, to the extent possible, that the open source project
stays open source, and the code in it is licensed properly. It is a
protection against, as an example, people acting in ill-faith, by contributing
something and later trying to get the contribution removed, causing harm
to the open source project.

## Why are we doing it like this?

Traditionally a contributor would need to print the CLA, sign it,
and physically e-mail it to us. This process takes a long time
and is hampering the productiveness for the contributor, and
us as open source project maintainers.

Inspired by others, we are collecting signed CLA's by accepting them
as close to our open source projects as possible, here at GitHub.

We believe it is a lot more convenient, and stream-lined, for everyone
involved and we hope you feel the same.
